  \section{Lecture 32}
  \subsection{Triple-slit Phasors}
  If each vector has magnitude $E_0$ and is an angle $\phi$ relative to the previous vector, then we have a few special cases:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\phi = 0$ \\
    The vectors are all in the same direction, so
    \[
      E_p = 3E_0. \tag{maximum}
    \]
    \item $\phi = \frac{2\pi}{3}$ \\
    The vectors rotate to form an equilateral triangle, so
    \[
      E_p = 0.
    \]
    \item $\phi = \pi$ \\
    The first two vectors cancel, leaving the last one, so
    \[
      E_p = E_0. \tag{2\tsup{nd} maximum}
    \]
  \end{itemize}
  \subsection{Diffraction Gratings}
  As a function of $\phi$, you have constructive interference where $\phi = \pm m\cdot 2\pi$, and destructive interference where $\phi = \frac{2\pi}{N}$. If you only have a single slit, you can still have destructive interference when $d\sin\theta = \frac{\lam}{2}$ (which can be shown using a picture).
