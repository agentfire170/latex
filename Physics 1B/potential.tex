  \section{Electric Potential Energy and Voltage}
  You can store energy as electric potential energy and convert it back to kinetic energy on demand. To move a charge against the electric force generated by a capacitor, you need to perform work: $W = F\cdot d = (q\cdot E)\cdot d$. If you let the charge go, we have conservation of energy: $qEd = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. \par
  All this is nice, but if you double the charge then you double the work and stored energy. To get a quantity that describes the energy storage capability of the field (that does not depend on $q$), we must define a new quantity. We say that \emph{electric potential} is defined by $V = \frac{U}{q}$. It is measured in $\frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{C}}$, or in volts ($\mathrm{V}$). For a homogeneous electric field, we have
  \[
    V = \frac{U}{q} = \frac{qEd}{q} = E\cdot d.
  \]
  \begin{note}{}
    Since we have $E = \frac{V}{d}$, we can measure electric field in $\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{C}}$.
  \end{note}
  \subsection{Gravity Analogue to Electric Potential}

    $U = mgh$ & $U = qEd$
  \end{tabular}\end{center}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Move a mass/charge against the field/force increases $U$ and $V$.
    \item Moving a mass/charge perpendicular to the field does not change $U$ and $V$.
    \item $V$ is a measure of how much energy a mass/charge would have at that point.
    \item Equipotential lines are perpendicular to the field. No work is done along those lines.
  \end{itemize}
  We define \emph{voltage} to be the potential difference between two points: $\Delta V = V_A - V_B$. Potential is a relative number but voltage is not. You must set the potential to zero somewhere (typically ground, one plate, or far away from a charge).
